This is Islandora's installation of the Internet Archive Bookviewer.
Callbacks provide the Bookviewer with exif parameters, and an ordered list of page images.
The default configuration assembles draws TIFF datastreams from Fedora, but
additional callbacks could be easily implemented to construct page lists from
other input types.
